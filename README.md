📦 What is python5?

python5 v1.0 is a next-generation execution engine that supercharges plain Python scripts using advanced mathematics, compiler rewrites, tensor factorization, hybrid AI acceleration, and multi-paradigm optimization — without requiring a single change to your code.

Think of it as a transcendental runtime, blending:

⚡ TorchInductor + AOT-TS graphing

🧠 LLM-specific optimization (FlashAttention, 4-bit quant, device maps)

🔥 Tensor-Train & Low-Rank Sparse decomposition (TT/LRS)

♾ 4D Rotational Embeddings (SO(4) math)

🔷 Category Theory graph fusion

🧮 Geometric Algebra symbolic rewriting

🧬 E-Graph / Term Rewriting System optimizations

💾 Eternal deterministic cache (script hash → compiled wrapper)

All in one file. Zero boilerplate. Zero syntax changes.

🚀 Quick Start

First, download or clone python5.py.

Linux / macOS (bash/zsh)

Add this to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:
alias python5='python3 /full/path/to/python5.py'
source ~/.bashrc

Windows Powershell
function python5 { python "C:\path\to\python5.py" $args }

Windows CMD
doskey python5=python C:\path\to\python5.py $*

RUN IN!
python5 yourfile.py

That's it.

python5 will automatically:

Parse & rewrite your script using AST + math-fusion passes

Inject LLM acceleration (flash attention, 4-bit quant, hybrid hook)

Build a persistent compiled wrapper

Collapse the execution graph into a faster backend

Apply hybrid Tensor-Train + Low-Rank Sparse acceleration to any large model

Cache everything forever using its “ETERNAL” hashing engine

Your original script stays untouched.

🧬 Architecture Summary (“How python5 Works”)
1. Pre-Execution Math Pipeline

Before execution, your script is rewritten using:

Geometric Algebra optimizer — replaces patterns like x*x with x.norm_sq().

Category Theory Fusion — functor-level call folding.

Term Rewriting / E-Graphs — high-level algebraic optimizations.

LLM Accelerator — injects:

load_in_4bit=True (bitsandbytes)

FlashAttention v2

Device map automation

Hybrid post-load hooks

2. Hybrid Acceleration Engine (Level 3)

After the model loads:

Tensor-Train (TT) decomposition replaces huge linear layers

Low-Rank Sparse (LRS) factorization compresses projections

4D Rotational Embeddings wrap embeddings in SO(4) transforms

CPU FlashAttention avoids constructing QKᵀ matrices

Operator Fusion merges linear + activation into single fused ops

The model keeps all intelligence but uses far fewer FLOPS.

3. Eternal Wrapper Cache

python5 fingerprints:

Your script

Python version

PyTorch version

Hardware/GPU name

Installed optional math libs

A unique wrapper is compiled and stored in:
~/.cache/python5_v3_0/

4. Final Execution Collapse

The runtime decides dynamically:

TorchInductor (NVIDIA)

AOT-TS (CPU)

OpenVINO backend

AMP bf16 acceleration

Zero-GIL path (Python 3.14+)

python5 executes your script in a mathematically optimized singularity space for maximum speed, automatically.

🎯 Mission Statement

python5 exists for one purpose:

**To push Python beyond its limits through mathematics, compilers, and engineering —

without breaking backward compatibility or user experience.**
